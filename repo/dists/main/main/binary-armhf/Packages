Description: Determine British holidays - Current UK public and bank holiday dates up to 2023
 A Date::Holidays style package updated with the British bank holiday dates
 now published at https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays. Holidays may apply to all
 regions, or some combination - see the regions parameter for more details.
 .
 N.B. - Dates of future holidays may occasionally be updated after they've
 been published.
 .
 Module is named with correct ISO-3166-1 code for the United Kingdom: "GB"
 (Great Britain)
 .
 To just work with holiday days for a single region, use one of the
 subclasses: Date::Holidays::GB::EAW, Date::Holidays::GB::NIR, or
 Date::Holidays::GB::SCT.

Description: SUPER class for the Date::Holidays::* modules
 This is a SUPER class intended for use by Date::Holidays::* modules.
 .
 The goal is to have all the existing and future modules implement the same
 methods, so they will have a uniform usage and can be used in polymorphic
 context or can be easily adapted into the Date::Holidays class.
 .
 The class provides two methods: is_holiday and holidays an alternative to
 this class is Date::Holidays::Abstract, which does not implement these
 methods, but require that they are implemented.
 .
 If you want to use Date::Holidays::Super and want to comply with my
 suggestions to the methods that ought to be implemented, you should overload
 the methods provided by this class, when and if you have the time in your
 Date::Holidays::* module.
