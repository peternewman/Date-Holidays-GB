Description: SUPER class for the Date::Holidays::* modules
 This is a SUPER class intended for use by Date::Holidays::* modules.
 .
 The goal is to have all the existing and future modules implement the same
 methods, so they will have a uniform usage and can be used in polymorphic
 context or can be easily adapted into the Date::Holidays class.
 .
 The class provides two methods: is_holiday and holidays an alternative to
 this class is Date::Holidays::Abstract, which does not implement these
 methods, but require that they are implemented.
 .
 If you want to use Date::Holidays::Super and want to comply with my
 suggestions to the methods that ought to be implemented, you should overload
 the methods provided by this class, when and if you have the time in your
 Date::Holidays::* module.
 .
 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
